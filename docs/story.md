# Our Story

### 2013-2022
James & Chris met in 2013 at a workshop, instead of listening to what was being presented, they spent their time building a tool which allows teachers to import their schedule into Google Calendar. Since then they have spent their time tinkering and making cool stuff, from home automation, to large commercial products. They have been featured in Magazine articles, the Google for Education blog for Global Accessibility Awareness Day and presented at conferences across North America. 

### 2023-2024
In 2023 Chris had the opportunity to take part in the first ever Dell Education Innovation Accelerator, and out of this using experience from both the Innovation Accelerator and the Google Innovation Academy, Zip Captions was born. Since then what was a dream to make the classroom more accessible for students with hearing loss, has turned into a tool used by over 1000 users. Our tools are used by individuals, places of worship and entire school districts to name but a few.

Solutions Zip (Operating as Zip Captions and Zip Solutions) is a registered business in Quebec.
