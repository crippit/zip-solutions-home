# Giving Back

### Giving back to our community is important

Each month we re-distribute the unused tokens from the previous month. Tokens are allocated to the following people:
- People who want to run a training session on Zip Captions (1 hour of tokens per month)
- People who work for Non-Profit Organisations
- People who run open source projects 
- People who work in Education

There is no promise of token availability, and if you require a guarantee of tokens please support one of our paid tiers on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/zipcaptions).

If you meet the criteria listed above, please click the button below to get started.
