# Zip Panel Chrome Extension

Are you tired of missing out on audio content while you browse or work? The Zip Captions Chrome Extension is a powerful Chrome extension designed to keep you in the loop by displaying the captions from Zip Captions in a convenient, always-accessible overlay. Whether you're watching presentations, live streams, or any web content that generates live text, our extension ensures those captions are visible across all your Chrome tabs or even in a separate, floating window that stays with you.

The extension allows you to multitask effectively without losing track of spoken content. Customize the overlay's appearance to perfectly match your viewing comfort with adjustable background opacity and text size. Choose to have captions displayed discreetly at the bottom of your pages or "pop out" the overlay into its own resizable window for maximum flexibility. Stay informed, stay productive, and never miss a word, no matter where you browse!

Key Features:

- Universal Caption Display: View live captions from Zip Captions on any other Chrome tab you are currently using.
- Persistent Overlay: A clean overlay appears at the bottom of your browser, showing live captions.
- Pop-out Window Mode: Detach the caption overlay into a separate, minimal window that can be moved anywhere on your screen and stays visible. Ideal for resizing underneath your window, as can be seen in the screenshot above.
- Docking Functionality: Easily "dock" the pop-out window back, reverting captions to the in-page overlay mode.

Full Customization:
- Global Toggle: Enable or disable the overlay with one click.
- Background Opacity: Adjust the overlay's background transparency for optimal readability without obscuring page content.
- Text Size: Increase or decrease the caption text size to suit your needs.
- Smart Source Detection: Automatically identifies and captures captions from the Zip Captions site.
