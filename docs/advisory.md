# Meet our Advisory Board

### Our Advisory Board is formed of experts in the field of accessibility. Whether they are educators, experienced coders or people with lived experiences surrounding accessibility, our Advisory Board members are our guiding light. They help to guide our product development, they suggest new ideas, and tell us when things are not going quite right. They are also our ambassadors, spreading the word and love of Zip Captions around the world.
