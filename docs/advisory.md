They are also our ambassadors, spreading the word and love of Zip Captions around the world.

Jordyn Zimmerman is a passionate educator and disability advocate. After being diagnosed as autistic at a young age, she did not receive access to augmentative communication until the age of 18. That arduous journey fuels her beliefs around leveraging tools and supports to drive change. She now thrives on boldly showing up and redefining what is possible in learning spaces and throughout the broader community — and has personal experience challenging the status quo, which is featured in the 2021 documentary, This Is Not About Me. 

Technology enabled effective communication, and Jordyn began advocating through a series of presentations and keynotes around the world. She has played a pivotal role on several projects focused on accessibility — and her insights on autism and inclusion have been published in places such as The Boston Globe and The New York Times, as well as quotes in The 19th. Jordyn is Board Chair of the nonprofit CommunicationFIRST, an Apple Distinguished Educator, and serves on The United States President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. An avid advocate for all learners, Jordyn's vision is clear: To ensure everyone is able to access effective communication and exercise their right to truly inclusive communities.

Jordyn earned her Bachelor's degree in Education Policy from Ohio University and her Master's of Education at Boston College. She is currently pursuing her Master's of Business Administration.

Kevin is a proud husband to his wife of 40 years, a father of four adult children.  He owns and operates a dairy farm equipment business his parents started in 1982.  He also owns and operates a manufacturing business he started in 2016.  He is a Christian who is active in his church, serving in several leadership roles over the years.  He fielded questions from shut-ins about audio problems with the church’s cable TV broadcast of its services.  This led him to seek an informal education in the implementation and use of audio, and later video, equipment in a church setting.  Eventually this journey led to the desire to incorporate assistive technology such as captions in the church’s cable TV and live streaming broadcasts as well as for its in-person audience.  When investigating captioning he found WebCaptioner, and when it was retired, ZipCaptions.  As Kevin got to know the ZipCaptions founders and their goals, he became an enthusiastic Patreon and eventually a member of the advisory board.
