Kevin is a proud husband to his wife of 40 years, a father of four adult children.  He owns and operates a dairy farm equipment business his parents started in 1982.  He also owns and operates a manufacturing business he started in 2016.  He is a Christian who is active in his church, serving in several leadership roles over the years.  He fielded questions from shut-ins about audio problems with the church’s cable TV broadcast of its services.  This led him to seek an informal education in the implementation and use of audio, and later video, equipment in a church setting.  Eventually this journey led to the desire to incorporate assistive technology such as captions in the church’s cable TV and live streaming broadcasts as well as for its in-person audience.  When investigating captioning he found WebCaptioner, and when it was retired, ZipCaptions.  As Kevin got to know the ZipCaptions founders and their goals, he became an enthusiastic Patreon and eventually a member of the advisory board.
