Congregation Member of the Rock Valley First Reformed Church

> "When sound is available but not understood, it’s as if you are listening to a foreign language. With this closed caption I can follow the service and hear The Message. What a wonderful experience!"

### Kevin Bouwman
Rock Valley First Reformed Church & Advisory Board Member

> "Zip Captions makes it very easy to add live open captions to our service broadcasts for our livestream and our leased cable tv channel. We also incorporate live open captions on our in-person presentation screen.  We have people with hearing loss who appreciate the captions and people without hearing loss who’ve said they find the captions helpful.  The support team is very responsive when we needed help, and the development team has been very receptive to our feedback about how to improve and enhance the software."
