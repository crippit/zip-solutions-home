# Privacy Matters

We built Zip Captions to ensure that user privacy was at the forefront of what we did, and that is why we only collect an email address when you register so that we can personalise the services that we offer you. 

We also built Zip Captions for the Classroom, and we wanted to make sure that we safeguarded student data as much as possible. That is why we:

* Collect as little information as possible - only your email address
* Use a third party sign in service so we don't store your password
* Will never sell our information to other companies
* Delete inactive accounts after 30 days
* Encrypt your data on your local device for transcripts
* Do not use trackers, analytics or other tools to identify your browsing habits on our main sites
* Do not display or use ad's on our main sites

These are just a few of the ways that we help to protect your data, and your privacy.
