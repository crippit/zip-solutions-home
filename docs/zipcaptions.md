## Broadcast your captions

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
 <p>Broadcasting your captions allows you to get them to wherever the end viewer is located. Whether this is in the same room, or on the other side of the world, your viewers can follow along with your captions in realtime on their own device. This not only frees up real estate on your main screen, but allows your viewers to customise their own captioning view. With static share codes, the possibilities are endless.</p>

Your transcripts are stored securely in your browser and not on our servers, meaning that the only person who has access to what you said is you! Plus, once your're finished you can download them as an SRT, VTT or TXT file! Perfect for captioning that next video.</p>
