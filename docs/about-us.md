# Our Team

 We are a group of educators who want to make the world a more accessible place. We also believe that your privacy should be forefront and centre to everything that we do. We build needed tools in both the accessibility space, and offer bespoke services.

## Chris Webb
### CEO & Co-Founder

Chris is a High School Teacher born in the UK, he has experience of teaching both in the UK and Canada, at the Kindergarten to Grade 13 level. Chris' background in Computer Science sees him always looking for ways to integrate technology in the classroom and looking for alternative solutions to problems. He's a Google for Education Certified Innovator and Trainer, and is often seen at Educational Technology conferences. Chris has presented to the Ministry for Education on making schools more inclusive for those with hearing loss, and has had his articles published on blogs, in magazines, featured on websites and was the focus of the Google for Education Global Accessibility Day blog post.

He was the inspiration for behind bringing ZipCaptions to life, through a project led with Dell Education Canada. Through working with members of the d/Deaf community and teaching a number of students with hearing loss, Chris realised that there was a huge need for a well designed live captioning tool. Chris lives in Quebec with his family and three cats.
