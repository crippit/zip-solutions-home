### Assistive Listening Systems
Assistive Listening provides those with hearing loss the ability to have better access to sound. Generally these systems are installed in public locations, or in large venues such as:

* Places of Worship
* Theatres
* Auditoriums
* Meeting Rooms
* Concert Halls
* Conference Venues
These systems can work via Wi-Fi, Infrared, Magnetic Loops and via FM. We have experience of installing these systems in large theatre venues, and can connect you with industry professionals, as well as experts in hearing technology to ensure that you have a system which best meets the needs of your audience.

We offer a number of options including our innovative "install your own system" model, where we send you detailed instructions and a shopping list, so you to acquire your own equipment, install it and set it up. Not only does this reduce the cost of the system and the consultancy, but it also means that you understand how your system works, and how it is installed.
