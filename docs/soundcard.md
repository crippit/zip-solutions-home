# The Zip Captions USB Sound Card

Congratulations! You've got your hands on one of our awesome USB Sound Cards which allows you to add another audio input to any Linux, Windows or Mac based system with Plug and Play Compatibility. Why would you want one of these?

- Easily add another input to your laptop, avoiding annoying TRRS adapters which often don't work
- Input a line in from a professional mixer
- Loop audio out, to become an audio in, for a device with only a single TRRS input/output

TRRS is the connector which your headphones with a microphone makes use of, these connectors have an additional metal ring, which means that using a regular 3.5mm (1/8") connector often is not possible.

1. Plug the sound card into the computer
2. Open up [https://zipcaptions.app](https://zipcaptions.app)
